	 Because public policies and public resources are largely beneficial to poor people, it is they who suffer the harmful effects of corruption most grievously.
	To be dependent on the government for housing, healthcare, education, security and welfare, makes the poor most vulnerable to corruption since it stalls service
	delivery. Delays in infrastructure development, poor building quality and layers of additional costs are all consequences of corruption.
	Many acts of corruption deprive our citizens of their constitutional and their human rights.
